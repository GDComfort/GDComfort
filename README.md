Hi there! You've stumbled upon my github profile, whether by google, linkedin, or because one of my job applications linked you here!
My name is Guillaume and I am a third year student at concordia university of Edmonton!
You can call me by whatever pronouns you seem fit. I self-identify as Non-binary, and a non-legal first name I also go by is Das.

My cat is my profile picture :).

My specialties thus far involve HTML/CSS3/Javascript and a bit of Python!

For business/job purposes you may reach me at gldcomfort@gmail.com 

Have a great day!
