<h1>Hi there!</h1>
You've stumbled upon my github profile, whether by google, linkedin, or because one of my job applications linked you here!<br>
<strong>My name is Guillaume</strong> and I am a third year student at <b>Concordia university of Edmonton</b>!<br>
You can <b>call me by whatever pronouns you seem fit</b>. I self-identify as Non-binary, and a non-legal first name I also go by is <b>Das</b>.
  
<br>My cat is my profile picture :).

My specialties thus far involve HTML/CSS3/Javascript and a bit of Python!
